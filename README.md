Angela Lu's Simon Says Challenge with my own quirky twists. 
- Added replaySequence() to replay each level before your turn to click.

Things I learned from the challenge:
- Selection of elements with jQuery
- Style, text and attribute manipulations with jQuery
- Adding and removing Event Listeners
- Simple website animation with jQuery
